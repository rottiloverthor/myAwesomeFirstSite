		<h3>An Introduction</h3>
			<section>
				<p>When I was a small child, the world was full of possibility and novelty. The insides of clothing racks and displays were hiding spots, and the sun was a warm kiss on my skin. This site is an ode to those who continue to marvel at the world around them. It is a curation of poems, music, photographs, handwritten notes, and whatever else I happen to come across. Some of the pieces are from my own collection, others from people across time and space and emotion.</p>
