          <pre>
          	I announced my arrival as I entered this life,
          	A lavender door contrasted by iron streaked bricks. 
          	A dancer in mime's clothing, over time I learned
          	to raise my hand, my voice, and the spirits of those around me. 

          	As an artist might draw upon that sleeping dog on the porch, 
          	Or a musician on the unbridled joy captured in a child's twirl, 
          	I revel in the world I find myself perpetually lost in. 

          	But when it comes time for me to bid farewell,
          	May I leave as a soft sigh etched into 
          	the barren trees and the coursing river and the song of a robin,
          	quietly observing the passage of time.
          </pre>

       <!--need to expand on this, should be in third person, brief bio-->
       	<p> Your primary visual cortex processes the signals your brain receives into images to be comprehended. Instead of building a traditional about me page, I wanted to create a lense through which you could get to know me.</p>

<!--need to build out css fun times
	- quote should be a timberwolf gray
	- background should be a simple leaf pattern, similaer to leaves on shoes - need to sketch out and save as jpeg
	- everything after quote should also be centered, and probably need to tighten up font style and size
